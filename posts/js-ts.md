# Comparing JavaScript and TypeScript

JavaScript and TypeScript are two popular programming languages often used in web development. While JavaScript is one of the most widely used languages in the world, TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript, offers additional features that can improve code quality and make working on larger projects easier. Below, weâ€™ll explore the key differences between these languages and provide examples of their use.

## JavaScript

JavaScript is a programming language supported by all modern web browsers. It is dynamically typed, meaning that data types are determined at runtime rather than at compile time. Here is a simple example of JavaScript code:

```javascript
// JavaScript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet("Alice"); // Output: Hello, Alice!
```
